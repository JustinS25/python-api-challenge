- Found plotting properties online to adjust outputted figure of scatterplots:

- markeredgecolor: property that allowed me to create an edge to each marker on a scatterplot

- Learned how to create a function using the internet. Helped me create linregress_fn to output a scatterplot with a linear regression line

- Used plt.text() to plot equation on plot in linregress_fn(). Text prints in every plot at the minimum x value,minimum y value (aka. bottom left corner)
